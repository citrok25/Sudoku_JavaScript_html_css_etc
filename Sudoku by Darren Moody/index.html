        <h2>I am creating a Game project / Web App using a Grid and</h2>
        <h2>will be developing my own version of the game Sudoku!</h2>
        <h2>This version will use the MVC design pattern and will contain</h2>
		<h2>a Model, View, and Controller.</h2>
		<ul>
            <li>The Model contains functions, parameters and information about the state of the game, .</li>		
            <ul>
                <li>The 'game pieces' will be numbers contained within the cells of a table.</li>
				<li>The information such as a piece's location and value is manipulated, or changed, by the<br>
					user's controls, or the Controller, as laid out in the Viewside of the MVC pattern.</li>
				<li>The Controller will be contained within the View.</li>	
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
			<li>The View instantiates the interface for the game-play, how the game is displayed<br>
				to the user, including what the gameboard and game objects will look like.</li> 
            <ul>
				<li>This View is primarily where the look and feel of the game is produced.</li>
				<li>In a nutshell, the view produces the game interface, or game-board design.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>The Controller.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>"For this project, I'm not going to worry about separating the controller from the view into<br>
					a separate source file."</li>
                <li>For the case of Sudoku, I will have interactive cell objects and buttons, a 'helper' keypad<br>
					that gives the player the possible values possible for a particular cell, and a drop-down menu.</li>
				<li>All of these interactive objects would be considered the Controller side of the MVC pattern.</li>
                <li>Each object will contain parameters as needed for the gameplay.</li>
                <li>The Model for this game will contain and track the information for all of these things.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
	
    <h3>Playing this Version of Sudoku:</h3>
    <ul><li> My Sudoku game will be generating a Sudoku table that is made up of 81 separate cell objects<br>
		in a 9 x 9 table. The 9 x 9 table will be made up of 9 separate 3 x 3 tables, which I will call mini-grids.<br>
		My functions for generating the table will be passing objects as parameters, which objects will<br> 
		contain the parameters for creating the table size, as well as states contained in arrays.<br>
		The parameters contained in the objects will be shown below.</li>
        <li>The player will see a blank game-grid and other elements of the game's interface</li>
        <li>The player must select a difficulty from the drop-down list of difficulties and a new puzzle of that difficulty will auto-load on selection.</li>
		<li>Each new puzzle generated will be UNIQUE and RANDOM, having been created using a back-tracking algorithm</li>
        <li>A certain number of cells will be left blank on the game-grid depending on the difficulty chosen. <br>
			The harder the difficulty chosen, the more blank cells you will start out with.</li>
        <li>The player can select any empty-cells on the game-grid and the possible correct answers for that cell will be given in a separate clickable grid called the keypad.</li>
        <li>The player can click a 'Check Answers' button to check their answers at any time during the game.</li>
        <li>If all the answers are correct a message will say "everything is good so far", or if there is a conflict the conflicting cells will be highlighted in red".</li>
        <li>Once all of the numbers have been filled in and all of the answers are correct, you have won the game! The game is over and a 'you win' message will display.</li>
    </ul>
	<h3>Winning the game: </h3>
	<ul>
        <li>In order to win at Sudoku you must enter the numbers 1 through 9 in each row, column, and mini-grid (3 x 3 table<br>
            within the larger table grid). You may enter the numbers in any order but you cannot repeat the same number twice <br>
            in any corresponding row, column, or mini-grid. For example, if there is already a 6 in a given row, then there <br>
            must not be another 6 in the same horizontal row (across the entire board), vertical column (across the entire board)<br>
            or in the same 3 x 3 mini-grid, or else one of the sixes must be in the wrong place...this is called a "conflict"!!! <br>
            Once you have filled in the entire Sudoku Game Board with numbers 1 - 9, having no conflicts, YOU WIN!</li>
    </ul><hr>	   

    <h3>The Model (SudokuModel.java)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>NUM_CELLS is the number of cells on the gameboard (81, 9 * 9)</li>
        <li>Numbers possible for each cell are (1 - 9)</li>
        <li>I will make an attempt at generating new, unique game puzzles.</li>
        <li>There will be 4 or 5 difficulties to choose from ranging from Easy to Extra Hard.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li>SudokuModel - JavaScript file.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains information about the model</li>
            <ul>
                <li>There are 9 mini grids of 3 x 3 each within one large grid of 9 x 9. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>GridCellObject</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains information about a given cell</li>
            <ul>
                <li>For example: {"inUse": false, "number": 7}</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sudoku Objects and Game Board</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SudokuView.js - JavaScript file.</li>
        <ul>
			<li>New Game - Button</li>
            <li>Creates a new game-grid.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose Difficulty</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Will give a <strong>drop down select list with difficulty options.</strong></li>
            <li>I will produce the difficulty list using "select" and "option" html tags.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Numbers(my "game pieces")</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The grid will be populated with numbers</li>
            <li>The element objects associated with each number must have listeners to sense when they've been clicked</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <strong>Functions</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>CreateGameGridInHTML() will generate the html for the grid</li>
        <li>CreateGameBoardInHTML() will fill in the table with .
            <ul>
                <li>I will have an array of 81 numbers. I will populate the puzzle with this array and then remove a certain amount of numbers based on the chosen difficulty level</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Need a buildGameGrid() function which will create the table in the model</li>	
        <li>I will need to handle each button with an onClick function in JavaScript - example function buttonName.click(event)</li>
        <li>I will also handle cell click events in the same way as the buttons</li>
        <li>I will need methods to handle mouse overs and selections
            <ul>
                <li>MouseOver or MouseClick functions will take grid cell events as parameters.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>MouseOver or MouseClick functions should have some nice transitions for cells in the grid (shading or something)</li>
        <li>MouseOver or MouseClick functions should return the value in the cell that was selected</li>
    </ul><hr>
